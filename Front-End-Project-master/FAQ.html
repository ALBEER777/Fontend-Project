The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV.”

                        <p>People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.

                          Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
                          
                          Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.</p>

Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people.

                        <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.

                          How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.
                          
                          Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:
                          
                          The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.
                          The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.
                          The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.
                          Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.</p>

                        <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                          It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
                          
                          In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>

                        <p>1. Wash your hands frequently
                          Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
                          
                          Why? We frequently use our hands to touch objects and surfaces that may be contaminated. Without realizing it, we then touch our faces, transferring viruses to our eyes, nose and mouth where they can infect us. Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands — including the virus that causes COVID-19.
                          
                          2. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth
                          We often touch our faces without noticing it. Be aware of this, and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
                          
                          Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth and can then enter your body and make you sick.
                          
                          3. Cover your cough
                          Make sure that you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with the bend of your elbow or with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands.
                          
                          Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. By covering your cough or sneeze you avoid spreading viruses and other germs to other people. By using the bend of your elbow or a tissue and not your hands to cover your cough or sneeze, you avoid transferring contaminated droplets to your hands. This prevents you from contaminating a person or a surface through touching them with your hands.</p>

                        <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms can vary widely. Some people have no symptoms at all. But others become so sick that they need to stay in the hospital and may eventually need a machine to breathe.

                          The risk of developing dangerous symptoms of COVID-19 may be increased in people who are older. The risk may also be increased in people of any age who have other serious health problems — such as heart or lung conditions, weakened immune systems, obesity, or diabetes. This is similar to what is seen with other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu (influenza).
                          
                          Each of these factors can increase the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms. But people who have several of these other health problems are at even higher risk.</p>

                        <p>Testing rules have evolved during the pandemic, but one rule has remained consistent: if you have one of the main three symptoms of COVID listed by the NHS (fever, a persistent new cough, or loss of taste or smell) but don’t otherwise know if you have the virus, you should take a PCR test. And by analysing the study’s data, my colleagues and I have been able to see what proportion of participants experiencing any of these symptoms then go on to have a test shortly after their symptoms appear.

                          The results were surprising. In December 2020 we found that 25% of those who reported one of the three core symptoms didn’t report a PCR result shortly afterwards, suggesting they weren’t getting tested. This was despite there being plenty of spare testing capacity at the time.
                          
                          Armed with this information, we then sent out a survey to a sample of 4,000 users in the UK who had had symptoms but no test, to better understand why they didn’t get tested. We found this was mostly down to three reasons.</p>

                        <p>Viral tests are used to gauge whether you have a current infection. A negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the person's sample. This probably means that the person is not infected with the coronavirus. However, false negatives can occur for a number of reasons, including people being tested too soon after exposure to the virus (which may not let enough of the virus build up to a level that is detectable), differences in how well the coronavirus is able to make copies of itself in one person compared to in another person, and cases where sample collection (e.g. getting swabbed) does not, for whatever reason, capture enough of the virus.

                          One study from researchers at Johns Hopkins suggested that COVID-19 PCR tests conducted 3 to 5 days after a person is exposed that return a negative result shouldn't be relied on alone to gauge infection status, and that in addition, the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully evaluated by health professionals. The study also found that the false-negative rate is at a low point about 8 days after exposure.
                          
                          So if people think they've been exposed to COVID-19, they should quarantine, connect with a healthcare professional to map out a plan for when to get tested or take other steps to address their health, and monitor for symptoms.
                          
                          A negative test result for COVID-19 for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.</p>

                      <div class="panel-body">
                        <p>1. Plan a routine together
                          Try to establish a routine that factors in age-appropriate education programmes that can be followed online, on the television or through the radio. Also, factor in play time and time for reading. Use everyday activities as learning opportunities for your children. And don’t forget to come up with these plans together where possible.
                          
                          Although establishing a routine and structure is critically important for children and young people, in these times you may notice your children need some level of flexibility. Switch up your activities. If your child is seeming restless and agitated when you’re trying to follow an online learning programme with them, flip to a more active option. Do not forget that planning and doing house chores together safely is great for development of fine and gross motor functions. Try and stay as attuned to their needs as possible.
                          
                          2. Have open conversations
                          Encourage your children to ask questions and express their feelings with you. Remember that your child may have different reactions to stress, so be patient and understanding. Start by inviting your child to talk about the issue. Find out how much they already know and follow their lead. Discuss good hygiene practices. You can use everyday moments to reinforce the importance of things like regular and thorough handwashing. Make sure you are in a safe environment and allow your child to talk freely. Drawing, stories and other activities may help to open a discussion.
                          
                          Try not to minimize or avoid their concerns. Be sure to acknowledge their feelings and assure them that it’s natural to feel scared about these things. Demonstrate that you’re listening by giving them your full attention, and make sure they understand that they can talk to you and their teachers whenever they like. Warn them about fake news and encourage them – and remind yourselves – to use trusted sources of information such as UNICEF guidance.
                          
                          3. Take your time
                          Start with shorter learning sessions and make them progressively longer. If the goal is to have a 30- or 45-minute session, start with 10 minutes and build up from there.  Within a session, combine online or screen time with offline activities or exercises.
                          
                          4. Protect children online
                          Digital platforms provide an opportunity for children to keep learning, take part in play and keep in touch with their friends. But increased access online brings heightened risks for children’s safety, protection and privacy. Discuss the internet with your children so that they know how it works, what they need to be aware of, and what appropriate behavior looks like on the platforms they use, such as video calls.
                          
                          Establish rules together about how, when and where the internet can be used. Set up parental controls on their devices to mitigate online risks, particularly for younger children. Identify appropriate online tools for recreation together - organizations like Common Sense Media offer advice for age-appropriate apps, games and other online entertainment. In case of cyberbullying or an incident of inappropriate content online, be familiar with school and other local reporting mechanisms, keeping numbers of support helplines and hotlines handy.
                          
                          Don’t forget that there’s no need for children or young people to share pictures of themselves or other personal information to access digital learning.
                          
                          5. Stay in touch with your children’s education facility
                          Find out how to stay in touch with your children’s teacher or school to stay informed, ask questions and get more guidance.  Parent groups or community groups can also be a good way to support each other with your home schooling.</p>

Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there are cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

                          If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
                          
                          Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.</p>

                        <p>The U.N. health agency says the virus is mainly spread between people. Rain and snow might dilute any traces of the virus on benches or other outside objects, but transmission from surfaces is not believed to be a major contributor to the pandemic.

                          Scientists say the real concern about cold weather is that lower temperatures are more likely to keep people indoors _ potentially in more crowded spaces where the virus can spread more easily.
                          
                          Studies have shown that a significant percentage of spread happens within households when people are sharing common areas like kitchens and bathrooms.
                          
                          WHO and others have also warned that in indoor spaces with poor ventilation, transmission happens more easily because the virus can be spread in the air and infectious particles might remain suspended in the air for several hours.
                          
                          Superspreader events have been traced to nightclubs, gyms and even choir practices. The coronavirus does not transmit as often outdoors because fresh air disperses the virus particles and people are more easily able to keep their distance from others. But experts caution that if people spend extended periods of time outdoors close to others without wearing masks, coronavirus spread is still possible.
                          
                          Health officials say the best way to stop transmission of the virus is to wear a mask in public, stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from people not in your household and frequently wash your hands.

                        <p>Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e., have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.

                          However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.</p>

                        <p>No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.
                          The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine.</p>
